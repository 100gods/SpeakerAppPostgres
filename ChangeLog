	* Makefile: Add ChangeLogs to all the apps. Add makefile rule
	change-log to generate with less effort. Add TOOLSDIR variable as
	it the directory now referenced more than once. Make sure the
	ChangeLog is added to both -bin and -src distros.

2006-02-13 01:29  mokhov

	* Makefile: Implement automatic .tex usage generation by all the
	apps for future inclusion into the manual automatically. Adjust
	Makefiles and correct some minor usage info.

2006-01-22 19:03  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Fine-tune a bit more NeuralNetwork
	parameters based on the experiments with the revived TestNN to
	produce a better recognition rate. Adjust epoch testing part in
	error updates to be in the scale of the minimum error. Though this
	is still imprecise, but looks more appropraite as a scale.  Update
	a couple of comments.

2006-01-21 23:36  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Add revision to @version.

2006-01-15 15:51  mokhov

	* Makefile, README, testing.bat, testing.sh: Consistently space out
	copyright years.

2006-01-08 09:47  mokhov

	* SpeakersIdentDb.java: Add recommended serialVersionUIDs. Apply
	more unapplied conventions and remove conflicting variable name.

2006-01-03 02:53  mokhov

	* Makefile, README, testing.bat, testing.sh: Perform first round of
	copyright year updates to bump to 2006.

2006-01-02 14:45  mokhov

	* testing.bat: Similarly to testing.sh, enable assertions and
	reserve more memory for JVM.

2006-01-02 14:17  mokhov

	* Makefile: Add compilation of the .bz2 packages and computation of
	the .md5 checksums. Overall, clean up the Makefile a bit.

2005-12-31 23:24  mokhov

	* testing.sh: Instruct JVM to use 512Mb max Java partition of
	memory so that non-server machines no longer choke on OutOfMemory
	errors with the default 64Mb.

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java, SpeakersIdentDb.java, testing.bat,
	testing.sh: This mega commit includes a few large fixes and closes
	up a long standing bug #1273717. Specifically, SpeakerIdentApp has
	now the option "-aggr" to invoke the recently implemented
	FeatureExtractionAggregator for testing (for now as concatenation
	FFT and LPC until better alternatives are available). Debug
	FeatureExtractionAggregator so it actually works. This includes
	resetting the module parameters back to itself instead of just
	zeroing out because when MARF runs in the batch mode in the same
	JVM, we were able to run through only once successfully. Fix
	addition of the current thread to its group upon thread
	construction. Improve handling of the sub-module parameters with
	proper typechecks for the future.  For all this to work, especially
	for cloning of the Preprocessing modules, the default constructors
	had to be made public. Did not entirely estimate consequences of
	this.  The actual results of coupling FFT+LPC are rather pitiful at
	this point (need to implement F0 for more fruitful results).
	
	Re-synchronize MARF so that no deadlocks happen when the main
	thread calls its synchronized method and some other thread does the
	same (as in FeatureExtractionAggregator) causing both to hang.
	Instead make the synchronization a tad bit more granular in MARF in
	train(), recognize(), and startRecognitionPipeline() based on the
	objects being manipulated. Add a new method of checkSettings() and
	relax synchronization requirements on the version retrieval methos
	as there are no mutable data structures in there. This was deemed
	to be the source of the bug #1273717, but turned out to be
	unrelated and so is Debug's synchronization is fine.
	
	Now, the bug #1273717 is finally fixed, and the culprit turned out
	to be the Sample's class toString() method -- specifically
	inefficient implementation of String concatenation with "+".
	Replace all the operations in there with the StringBuffer instead
	to fix the problem.
	
	Clean up lots of code a long the way in various places along the
	way for names, error handling, and comments.

2005-12-07 19:47  mokhov

	* README, manifest.mf, testing.sh: Bulk-rename remaining entries of
	"The MARF Development Group" to "The MARF Research and Development
	Group".

2005-11-29 20:19  mokhov

	* retrain.lnk: Update the retrain shortcut with new options.

2005-11-29 20:18  mokhov

	* SpeakersIdentDb.java: Convert System.out.println() to
	Debug.debug().

2005-10-15 19:56  mokhov

	* Makefile: Update group's name with "Research".

2005-09-25 19:32  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Add a file name to the display similarly
	the way it was in the scripts.

2005-09-25 19:05  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Add date/time information.

2005-09-25 18:50  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Correct a bug of assigning initial expected
	ID to 0 instead of -1 that cause avoiding to look up one from the
	db. Add some cosmetic works.

2005-09-24 23:29  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Document new members.

2005-09-24 16:30  mokhov

	* testing.bat, testing.sh: Adjust testing scripts to use the new
	--batch-ident option.

2005-09-24 16:08  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Implement handling of the --single-train
	option to allow training on a single file (e.g. add a new sample to
	the training set without retraining the rest of the
	samples/clusters). Refactor the common code into the new train()
	method. In file checks, insist on the fact that something ends with
	".wav" must also be a regular file to improve robustness.

2005-09-24 15:18  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Implement the --batch-ident option to be
	able to run the app againt a directory of files to indetify,
	instead of just a single file.	This should help performance-wise
	because it avoids starting up a new JVM for each file to identify
	for each permutation of the configuration parameters. As a result
	of implementation, refactor some common code into the new ident()
	and getConfigString() methods.

2005-09-23 21:27  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Complete new option processing machinery
	applied to all aspects of the app. Resolve the nuances related to
	extracting a file or directory name along with the expected speaker
	ID.

2005-09-19 23:07  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Significantly advance new option
	processing. Major options are now part of the same option
	processing repertoire. Add switches setCustomConfig() to allow for
	option arguments and correct handling of ModuleParams across all
	types of modules. Clean up code and comments a bit. Add missing
	"--best-score" option to the usage(). Only thing that remains to
	address is the handing of valid "invalid" options for the file/dir
	name and/or the expected ID.

2005-09-18 13:57  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Begin using OptionProcessor. Start
	implementation of the --batch-ident and --single-train options. The
	new-code-so-far compiles but barely operational.

2005-09-17 21:45  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Minor cosmetic improvements.

2005-08-30 18:36  mokhov

	* testing.bat: Fix a bug in argument numbering for the TESTING case
	to avoid "-nn" to appear with "-fft" and "-randfe" as they cause
	out-of-memory errors in the current setup. Such bug did not exist
	in TRAINING because the arguments are not shifted right to
	accomodate a filename.

2005-08-28 13:21  mokhov

	* retrain.lnk: Add a Windows shortcut to testing.bat that supplies
	the --retrain option and so it is possible just to start retraining
	and the classification process on Windows just by double-clicking
	on the shortcut.

2005-08-27 19:03  mokhov

	* testing.bat: Complete preliminary version of the testing.bat
	equivalent of testing.sh.  Since M$ batch files don't have a notion
	of procedures, a tmp .bat files for loops, training, and
	identification are generated and used throughout the script. There
	are a few other little kludges in place, but at least it is
	something that works.

2005-08-27 13:57  mokhov

	* testing.sh: Re-add mistakingly removed testing.sh as a part of
	.bat clean up.

2005-08-27 13:41  susan_fan

	* testing.sh: remove mistakingly added testing.sh file.

2005-08-27 13:40  susan_fan

	* class.bat, feat.bat: Romove mistakingly added .bat files that are
	supposed to be generated.

2005-08-27 13:32  susan_fan

	* testing.sh: Remove mistakingly added .bat files that are supposed
	to be generated.

2005-08-27 13:17  susan_fan

	* class.bat:  be called by feat.bat

2005-08-27 13:09  susan_fan

	* feat.bat:  be called by testing.bat

2005-08-27 13:05  susan_fan

	* testing.bat: Add feat.bat and class.bat files be called by
	testing.bat. Not included "if" in training part and need to change
	testing part.

2005-08-23 23:23  mokhov

	* speakers.txt: Add Shivani.

2005-08-23 23:20  mokhov

	* training-samples/: shivani1.wav, shivani10.wav, shivani11.wav,
	shivani12.wav, shivani13.wav, shivani14.wav, shivani15.wav,
	shivani2.wav, shivani3.wav, shivani4.wav, shivani6.wav,
	shivani7.wav, shivani8.wav, shivani9.wav: Add training samples of
	Shivani's voice.

2005-08-23 23:20  mokhov

	* testing-samples/shivani5.wav: Add a testing sample of Shivani's
	voice.

	* Makefile: Force 1.4 sources for javac and javadoc. Fix a typo in
	maintainer-clean.

2005-08-23 20:37  mokhov

	* Makefile: Make sure the SpeakerIdentApp.jar is washed away by the
	maintainer-clean vacuum cleaner.

2005-08-23 20:30  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java, testing.sh: Add '-endp' option to enable
	the use of Endpoint in SpeakerIdentApp.

2005-07-30 18:56  mokhov

	training-samples/sx4.wav, training-samples/sx5.wav,
	training-samples/sx6.wav, training-samples/sx7.wav,
	training-samples/sx8.wav, training-samples/sx9.wav: Add Shuxin's
	voice samples. Forgot to add a long ago.

2005-06-19 00:48  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Display 2nd best anyway, regardless whether
	the expected speaker available or not. When not, don't count the
	stats, just display.  Document the code a little more.

2005-06-19 00:44  mokhov

	* speakers.txt: Add Shuxin to the list of speakers. Remove
	erroneous space and add testing sample.

2005-06-04 16:19  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Apply coding conventions to some remnant
	variables.

2005-06-04 15:36  mokhov

	* Makefile: Complete polishing distro targets making sure all stuff
	is in and replacing .class files with .jar ones in -bin and
	-bundle.

2005-06-04 15:27  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Do not spill out the error message on
	missing arguments, instead just display the usage information.
	Re-arrange some code at the beginning a little.

2005-06-03 23:12  mokhov

	* Makefile: Add testing.bat to the distro.

2005-06-03 23:05  mokhov

	* Makefile: Prepare Makefile for the upcoming 0.3.0-devel release:
	add new tarball for training sets, add COPYRIGHT and coding.html,
	Eclipse project files, and correct marf.jar enclosure. Add
	CLASSPATH to javadoc build so it also finds marf.jar and doesn't
	complain. Clean up Makefile in general.

2005-06-03 22:05  mokhov

	* manifest.mf: Add manifest file for SpeakerIdentApp.

2005-06-03 22:04  mokhov

	* README: Update README a bit to reflect more the today's
	0.3.0-devel situation.

2005-06-03 22:01  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Correct comment about exit code.

2005-06-03 21:53  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java, SpeakersIdentDb.java: Perform some code
	clean ups before 0.3.0-devel release.  Fix some formatting and
	spelling errors. From SpeakersIdentDb remove strDbFile and
	bConnected data members. The former is subsumed by StorageManager's
	strFilename and the latter was moved to Database, where it seems to
	belong. Apply some more coding conventions in places. Document a
	little more.

2005-06-01 22:50  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Replace usage of MARF.DEBUG with
	Debug.enableDebug().

2005-05-31 01:52  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Update usage() with the new options: -raw,
	-minmax, and -diff.

2005-05-24 23:56  mokhov

	* SpeakersIdentDb.java: Expand imports and update some comments.

2005-05-23 23:46  mokhov

	* SpeakersIdentDb.java: Extend from marf.Storage.Database now that
	we have it, and use StorageException instead of IOException or
	Exception. Now we are one more step closer to integration of the
	Database and StatsCollector code. Make use of Debug.debug() instead
	of deperecated MARF.debug().

2005-05-23 14:28  mokhov

	* SpeakersIdentDb.java: Begin clean up for code migration to MARF.

2005-05-22 11:35  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java, testing.sh: Add -raw, -minmax, and -diff
	options. Document  the code a bit more. Replace some usage of
	MARF.debug() with Debug.debug().

2005-05-17 11:19  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java, testing.sh: Add new "-highpassboost" option
	for the new Preprocessing module combo.  It works, but I am not
	very happy with the results yet... Plus, the order for some reason
	of including things matters, this will have to be fixed in MARF.

2005-05-16 17:17  mokhov

	* Makefile: Make sure we remove ~ backup files on maintainer-clean.

2005-05-12 21:46  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Remove redundant import.

2005-05-08 17:01  mokhov

	* SpeakersIdentDb.java: Correct a corner-case bug of having a
	single configuration for stats where the output result array had 1
	row less than necessary. The original coding was bogus anyway as it
	assumed to have as many rows as we have configurations, but there
	should only be two -- for the 1st and 2nd guesses. Make
	StatsPercentComparator a subclass of SortComparator which is
	already a couple of months in the main MARF CVS. Also artificially
	scale the compared values for not to miss .00 fractions. This will
	have to be reviewed.  Evetually this comparator will likely be also
	moved to MARF once StatisticCollector gets implemented.  Clean up
	imports. Clean up and improve javadoc comments.  Redirect some
	error messages to System.err.

2005-05-08 16:55  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Simply queirying for speakers' IDs and make
	less function calls.  Perform some code clean up. Redirect
	error-related messages to System.err in few places. Add the "-h"
	option as a short for "--help" that was liste in the Usage
	information, but was never actually accepted.  This commit confirms
	that the app works again with the current MARF
	ResultSet/Result-related fixes.  Clean up imports. Clean up and
	improve javadoc comments.

2005-05-08 16:51  mokhov

	* Makefile: Make sure we remove all stats-related-generated files
	on maintainer-clean as well as the *.gzbin files.

2005-05-04 18:33  mokhov

	* SpeakerIdentApp.java: Update the application to use the new
	ResultSet API of Classification.  This is a very incompatible
	change to the API, so this application version requires 0.3.0 of
	marf of more. Needs rigorous testing.
	
	Massage comments in places.

2005-04-23 16:43  mokhov

	* .classpath, .project: Add Eclipse's project files to our apps.
	They are all set dependent on the MARF project.

	against old API ( < 0.2.0 )
	
	As of this commit MARF's and SpeakerIdentApp's versions are the
